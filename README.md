# Creating a Music Streaming App

Musify is a full-stack web application that replicates some of the core features of Spotify. This project is built using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and EJS for server-side rendering, with CSS for styling. It also includes authentication mechanisms to manage user sessions securely. The project aims to provide a dynamic and responsive user interface while allowing users to browse and play music just like on Spotify.
